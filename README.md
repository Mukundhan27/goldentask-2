Golden Task: Build a spam filter using NLP and machine learning to
identify and filter out spam emails
Undertake a comprehensive climate data analysis project to explore and
understand historical climate patterns and trends. The objective is to derive
valuable insights from climate data, enabling a better understanding of weather
conditions over time.
Develop a robust Spam Email Filter using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques and machine learning algorithms. The goal is to create an intelligent
system capable of accurately classifying emails as either spam or legitimate
(ham) based on their content and linguistic feature
